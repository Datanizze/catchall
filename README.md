### CatchAll virtualhost for apache

A small script that will add a virtual host for apache which will setup automatic subdomains for a specified directory
Just for personal use but someone might get some use out of this... Don't expect any support if this messes up your virtual hosts

## Usage
	cd /dir/to/where/I/want/it
	git clone git://github.com/Datanizze/catchall.git
	cd catchall
	./doit.sh /path/to/my/public_html
